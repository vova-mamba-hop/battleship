--INTRO--
This is a standard game of battleship. You are allowed:
1 carrier (4 cells),
2 battleships (3 cells),
3 cruisers (2 cells), 
4 destroyers (1 cell).
You can remove the placed ship by clicking on the cell again.
To start the game select an opponent type and whether or not you would like to generate debug logs.
Currently there are only 2 opponents:
Random - randomly makes moves and retains no memory of previous moves.
Random Plus - also randomly makes moves but if it hits a ship, it will explore the neighboring cells until the ship is sunk.
